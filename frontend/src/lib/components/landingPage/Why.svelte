        <p>I'm Stijn. Frustrated with chaotic rules I decided a little while ago to built this website. To help anyone going on holiday, or planning a trip. While I hope I can be of some value, this website is also a project for me to get back into programming. I hope you find this website useful. Fee free to browse around or <a href="mailto:stijn@travelcheckr.eu" class="underline underline-offset-2">reach out</a>.</p>
